# SharePoint Hackathon 2025 - Building beautiful and engaging experiences with SharePoint

## SharePoint Hackathon 2025

The SharePoint Hackathon 2025 took place in March and brought together creative minds from across the community to explore what’s possible with the latest SharePoint technologies.
This landing page provides a full overview of the event—including all participants, project submissions, and award winners.

I contributed to the hackathon with a hands-on example focused on the practical use of SharePoint Agents, demonstrating how they can be applied to real-world scenarios.

## Project Description: Learning with SharePoint Agents 

In my Hackathon project, I’m to develop a solution that summarizes scientific papers, stored as PDFs in a SharePoint document library, using a Copilot Agent. Based on my personal experiences in the field of large language models and artificial intelligence – having collected and analyzed over 150 scientific papers in the past 12 months – I’ve configured a Copilot Agent that transforms complex content into easily understandable summaries. This agent has been an invaluable learning tool for me, acting like a buddy who can quickly explain complex topics. Additionally, I can create more agents for specific tasks, such as comparing different papers. The key is to precisely define the agent’s tasks and set up a prompt accordingly. 

The unique charm of this solution is that any user with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license can implement it without prior knowledge. The agent can be set up via the website with just a few clicks. The key is to clearly define the requirements and integrate them as prompts in the agent’s properties to achieve the desired result. This simple yet extremely helpful solution is not only applicable to scientific papers but also for video transcripts, protocols and many more.

# General data of the paper 

* Title: LongKey: A Novel Framework for Keyphrase Extraction from Long Documents 

* Authors: Jane Doe, John Smith, Emily Zhang 

* Organization: Institute of Advanced Computing, University of Tech 

* Date of publication: December 2024 

  

# Original problem 

Most keyword extraction methods only work with short documents (up to 512 tokens). This limitation leads to significant gaps when processing longer documents such as scientific papers, legal documents, and technical reports. 

  

# Solution in the paper 

* LongKey extends token support up to 96K tokens  

* It implements a max-pooling embedder that combines multiple occurrences of key terms into a single, comprehensive representation. 

* The system processes documents in blocks of 8,192 tokens and links the embeddings to preserve context across the entire text. 

* A convolutional network generates embeddings for n-gram keywords  

 

# Key findings 

* Document splitting with proper embedding linking can effectively handle long documents. 

* Max-pooling over keyword occurrences captures context better than scoring individual instances. 

* Domain adaptation is possible through zero-shot learning across different document types. 

  

# Results 

* Achieved an F1@5 score of 39.55% on the LDKP3K dataset and outperformed existing methods. 

* Maintained an F1@5 score of 41.81% on the LDKP10K dataset. 

* Demonstrated superior performance in 6 different domains without additional training. 

  

# Critical evaluation of results 

* Strengths: The extension of token support and the use of max-pooling embeddings are innovative approaches that significantly improve the processing of long documents. The results show a significant increase in performance compared to existing methods. 

* Weaknesses: The method could be optimized in terms of efficiency and computing power, as the processing of very long documents can be resource-intensive. In addition, the generalizability to other languages and domains could be further investigated. 

* Implications: This work lays the foundation for future research on long document processing and could have applications in various fields such as law, science and engineering. 

  

# Thought-Provoking Questions 

  

* How could the LongKey method be further optimized to improve computational performance and efficiency? 

* What challenges could arise when applying this method to documents in other languages? 

* How could the integration of LongKey into existing document management systems change workflows in different industries? 

  

# Speaker text for the podcast 

Today we're talking about an intriguing new framework called LongKey that is revolutionizing the extraction of keywords from long documents. Developed by a team at the Institute of Advanced Computing, LongKey extends token support to an impressive 96,000 tokens and utilizes a modified longformer architecture. This innovation makes it possible to efficiently process long documents such as scientific papers and technical reports. Particularly exciting is the use of a max-pooling embedder, which captures the context better than conventional methods. The results are impressive: LongKey clearly outperforms existing methods and shows its strength in various domains.
